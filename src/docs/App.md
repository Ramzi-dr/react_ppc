## Overview

This file is part of a React educational project. It is intended to teach students React by example. Below is a detailed explanation of the code in `App.jsx`.

## Code Walkthrough

```
// src/App.jsx
import { Routes, Route, Navigate } from "react-router-dom";
import ProtectedRoute from "./ProtectedRoute";
import Home from "./Home";
import Login from "./Login";
import Settings from "./Settings";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app-wrapper">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/login" element={<Navigate to="/" />} />
        <Route
          path="/home"
